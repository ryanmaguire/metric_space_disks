# Metric Space Disks
The standard Euclidean metric in the plane yields
the standard unit disk. That is, the *circular*
disk in the plane centered about the origin. By
changing the metric one gets a different unit disk.
For example, the L1 metric creates *diamonds* and the
L-infinity metric produces *squares*. While all of these
metrics are topologically equivalent, they are not
isometric. This repository provides tools for creating
rasterized images of the unit disks of arbitrary metrics
in the plane. In particular, for all p greater than
1, we can consider the Lp norm, and then work with the
induced metric. The resulting unit disks are geometrically
different for all p, even if they are topologically
equivalent.
